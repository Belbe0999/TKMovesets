# Extraction #
extraction.explanation = Movesets have to first be extracted from the game into files on your computer to be then used. Extracts only movesets : nothing visual.\nExtraction is done with the game running (from memory), with the target character(s) loaded and visible on the screen (it doesn't matter what gamemode).

extraction.extract_2p = Extract (2P)"
