# Extraction #
extraction.explanation = Movesets have to first be extracted from the game to be then used. Extracts only movesets : not models or visual effects.\nExtraction is done with the game running (from memory), with the target character(s) loaded and visible on the screen (it doesn't matter what gamemode).
extraction.cannot_extract = Movesets cannot be extracted.
extraction.extracted_movesets = Extracted movesets
extraction.extract_1p = Extract (1P)
extraction.extract_2p = Extract (2P)
extraction.extract_both = Extract (1P & 2P)
extraction.overwrite_duplicate = Overwrite moveset with same name

# Importation #
importation.explanation = After movesets are extracted and saved on your computer, they can be loaded into an active game (must not be online) using this submenu. This is a one time only thing: movesets loaded here will be unloaded after you pass through any loading screen, so this is mainly for training mode use.\nFor online play, see the "Online" section.
importation.cannot_import = Movesets cannot be imported.
importation.select_moveset = Select moveset
importation.import_1p = Import to 1P
importation.import_2p = Import to 2P
importation.deallocate_unused = Deallocate unused movesets

# Online #
online.explanation = Online play requires both players to have this tool running.\nYou must each select your moveset before the match's loading screen, the tool will in the background download the opponent's moveset on your computer and apply it to them and will do the same on their end.\nCustom movesets will not be loaded if you or the opponent do not have the tool running with a valid moveset selected.
online.select_moveset = Select moveset
online.no_selected_moveset = No moveset selected
online.moveset_x_selected = Moveset {} selected

# Moveset Edition #
edition.explanation = You can here edit extracted movesets. Refer to documentation for tutorials and helpful ressources.\nTurn on 'Live edition' for quickly modifying the custom moveset: Simple values changes will be instantly applied in memory with zero loading time.
edition.suggest_new_name = This moveset appears to be a freshly extracted one. Do you want to give the modified copy a new name?
edition.no_custom_loaded = Load a custom moveset in memory to be able turn on live edition
edition.non_trivial_detected = A non-trivial change was detected and requires re-importation to be applied.
edition.target_player = Target player:
edition.warning_target_change = Changing selected player while live edition is on will turn off live edition for the old player. Continue?
edition.custom_loaded = Custom moveset loaded
edition.enable_live = Enable live edition
edition.disable_live = Disable live edition
edition.save = Save
