# Extraction #
extraction.explanation = Movesets have to first be extracted from the game to be then used.

online.explanation = Online play requires both players to have this tool running.\nYou must each select your moveset before the match's loading screen, the tool will in the background download the opponent's moveset on your computer and apply it to them and will do the same on their end.\nCustom movesets will not be loaded if you or the opponent do not have the tool running with a valid moveset selected.

online.no_selected_moveset = No moveset selected
online.moveset_x_selected = Moveset '%s' selected
